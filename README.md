Installation
------------

### Third-party hosted

1. Include the following lines in HTML page right before the closing `</head>` tag.

    ```
    <!-- jQuery -->
    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- jPlayer Jukebox add-on -->
    <link type="text/css" href="//gyrocode.github.io/jplayer-jukebox/0.6.8/skin/uno/jplayer.uno.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//gyrocode.github.io/jplayer-jukebox/0.6.8/jplayer.jukebox.bundle.min.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
       $(document).ready(function(){
          // Initialize jPlayerJukebox
          var jpjb = new jPlayerJukebox({
             'jukeboxOptions': {
                'position': 'float-bl'
             }
          });
       });
    </script>
    ```

    If you are already using jQuery library on your page, you can skip the line that includes it above.


### Self-hosted

1. Follow instructions in [jPlayer Quick Start Guide](http://jplayer.org/latest/quick-start-guide) on how to download and install jPlayer on your server. It is recommended to upload jPlayer into a separate folder, for example `/js/jplayer`.

2. Download jPlayer Jukebox add-on, unzip the ZIP file and upload the files into the same location where you have uploaded jPlayer files.

    For example, if you have uploaded jPlayer into `/js/jplayer` folder, then the add-on should be placed in `/js/jplayer/add-on` folder and Uno skin - in `/js/jplayer/skin` folder.

3. Include the following lines in HTML page right before the closing `</head>` tag if you haven't done so already.

    ```
    <!-- jQuery -->
    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- jPlayer Jukebox add-on -->
    <link type="text/css" href="/js/jplayer/skin/uno/jplayer.uno.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jplayer/jquery.jplayer.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jplayer/add-on/jplayer.playlist.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jplayer/add-on/jplayer.jukebox.min.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
       $(document).ready(function(){
          // Initialize jPlayerJukebox
          var jpjb = new jPlayerJukebox({
             'swfPath': '/js/jplayer',
             'jukeboxOptions': {
                'position': 'float-bl'
             }
          });
       });
    </script>
    ```

    If you have uploaded jPlayer into folder other than `/js/jplayer` folder, please modify the code accordingly.

    If you are already using jQuery library on your page, you can skip the line that includes it above.
